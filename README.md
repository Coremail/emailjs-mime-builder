# mailbuild

*mailbuild* is a low level RFC2822 message composer. Define your own mime tree, no magic included.

This is work in progress. Even though the module already works (see *example/index.html*), it is far from finished.

## Usage

### Volo

Install with [volo](http://volojs.org/):

```shell
volo add Kreata/mailbuild/master
```
## Methods

**TODO**

## Tests

Download `mailbuild` source and install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kreata/mailbuild.git
cd mimetypes
volo install
```

Tests are handled by QUnit. Open [testrunner.html](tests/testrunner.html) to run the tests.

**THERE ARE NO ACTUAL TESTS YET, IT IS JUST A PLACEHOLDER**
